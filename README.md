It's written using the C++ programming language.

## Features

## How to Use 
⚠ **WARNING:** In order to open the project, I recommend using the Visual Studio IDE. If you want the source file, it's located in the Calculator folder.
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone 
2. In the Basic_Calculator folder, open Calculator.sln
3. In order to perfom any kind of mathematical operation, you can use the already instantiated Calculator object and call the defined methods.(⚠ **This has to be done in the int main() function**)
