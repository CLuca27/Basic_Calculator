⚠ **WARNING:** In order to open the project, I recommend using the Visual Studio IDE. If you want the source file, it's located in the Calculator folder.
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/CLuca27/Basic_Calculator.git
2. In the Basic_Calculator folder, open Calculator.sln
